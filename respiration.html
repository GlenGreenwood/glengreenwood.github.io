        <h3>A Word about Falalalala (Phosphorilation)</h3>
        <p>There are two main types of phosphorilation. The first is known as <em>substrate-level phosphorilation</em>. This variety uses an enzyme within the cytoplasm OR mitochondria to form ATP from ADP and a phosphate attached to a <i>"high-energy substrate"</i> (such as a pyruvate).</p>
        <p><em>Oxidative phosphorilation</em> is the process by which most ATP is produced. It uses hydrogen-powered ATP Synthase to combine free ADP and Pi. As the hydrogen fills the matrix of the mitochondra it combines with free oxygen and becomes water. </p>

    <h3>More Details:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Glucose is one of three basic sugars (Carbohydrates, monosaccarides) the others are fructose and galactose.</li>
            <li>Oxygen can speed up and increase the efficiency of respriation. It is necessary to the process.</li>
            <li>Oxygen prevents the matrix and synthase from clogging</li>
            <li>Fermentation is an alternate method of energy production that doesn't need oxygen, but it's products are typically somewhat toxic.</li>
        </ul>
