    <h3>In a Nutshell:</h3>
    <p><em>Plants absorb light and use it to separate hydrogen from a water molecule.
         The oxygen that remains is released as O2.
          The hydrogen from water is used to turn ATP Synthase so that it can make ATP. 
          ATP powers the process that creates a glucose molecule.</em></p>

    Water supplies hydrogen for ATP production
    Sunlight provides energy for photophosphorylation
    Oxygen is required for root respiration
    Phosphorus is needed to make ATP
