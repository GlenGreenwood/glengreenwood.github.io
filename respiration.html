        <h3>In a Nutshell:</h3>
        <p><em>Plants absorb light and use it to separate hydrogen from a water molecule.
         The oxygen that remains is released as O2.
          The hydrogen from water is used to turn ATP Synthase so that it can make ATP. 
          ATP powers the process that creates a glucose molecule.</em></p>

        <h3>A Word about Falalalala (Phosphorilation)</h3>
        <p>There are two main types of phosphorilation. The first is known as <em>substrate-level phosphorilation</em>. This variety uses an enzyme within the cytoplasm OR mitochondria to form ATP from ADP and a phosphate attached to a <i>"high-energy substrate"</i> (such as a pyruvate).</p>
        <p><em>Oxidative phosphorilation</em> is the process by which most ATP is produced. It uses hydrogen-powered ATP Synthase to combine free ADP and Pi. As the hydrogen fills the matrix of the mitochondra it combines with free oxygen and becomes water. </p>
