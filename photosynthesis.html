        <h3>In a Nutshell:</h3>
        <p><em>Plants absorb light and use it to separate hydrogen from a water molecule.
         The oxygen that remains is released as O2.
          The hydrogen from water is used to turn ATP Synthase so that it can make ATP. 
          ATP powers the process that creates a glucose molecule.</em></p>

        <h3>A Word about Fertilizer</h3>
        <p> Most plants require varying amounts of 16 elements to grow. These include:
            <ul>
                <li>Carbon</li>
                <li>Hydrogen</li>
                <li>Oxygen</li>
                <p>The essential environmental elements</p>
                <li>Nitrogen</li>
                <li>Phosphorus</li>
                <li>Potassium</li>
                <p>The three main "macro nutrients"</p>
                <li>Calcium</li> 
                <li>Magnesium</li>
                <li>Sulfur</li>
                <li>Iron</li> 
                <li>Manganese</li> 
                <li>Copper</li> 
                <li>Zinc</li> 
                <li>Boron</li> 
                <li>Molybdenum</li> 
                <li>Chlorine</li>
                <p>The micro nutrients. Some are needed in high enough quantities that there is some debate about whether they should be considered micronutrients, while others may be needed in such small amounts that they only need to be added once in two generations.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>These nutrients are found in most genaric fertilizers, but most people have little understanding of what they really do for the plant. Many explanations, and the name "fertilizer" itself indicated that is has something to do with pollination. The truth is that these elements are the building blocks that allow plants to function down to a molecular level.</p>
                <p>Nitrogen makes up the protiens, including enzymes (like ATP Synthase) that are central to the function of plants and all the life that relies on them. Phosphorus is essential as a major component in ATP. One of the less used, but still essential, nutrients is magnesium. Each chlorophyll pigment molecule, a green pigment that absorbs light energy as photosynthesis begins, has a magnesium atom at it's center. </p>
            </ul>

    <!-- APPLICATIONS TO AGRICULTURE
    Water supplies hydrogen for ATP production
    Sunlight provides energy for photophosphorylation
    Oxygen is required for root respiration
    Phosphorus is needed to make ATP
