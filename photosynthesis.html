<h7><em>Photosynthesis in a nutshell:</em></h7>
<p><em>Plants absorb light and use it to separate hydrogen from a water molecule.
     The oxygen that remains is released as O2.
      The hydrogen from water is used to turn ATP Synthase so that it can make ATP. 
      ATP powers the process that creates a glucose molecule.</em></p>
