<H1>Photosynthesis:</H1>
<h3>In a Nutshell:</h3>
<p><em>Plants absorb light and use it to separate hydrogen from a water molecule.
     The oxygen that remains is released as O2.
      The hydrogen from water is used to turn ATP Synthase so that it can make ATP. 
      ATP powers the process that creates a glucose molecule.</em></p>

            <li>Chlorophyll absorbs light energy (photons)</li>
            <li>Light energy splits water into hydrogen and oxygen</li>
            <li>Oxygen is released as O₂</li>
            <li>Hydrogen is pumped into the thylakoid</li>
            <li>Hydrogen flows through ATP Synthase</li>
            <li>ATP is produced from ADP and Pi (photophosphorylation)</li>
            <li>NADP⁺ picks up hydrogen to form NADPH</li>

            <li>CO₂ enters the chloroplast</li>
            <li>Carbon from CO₂ binds to a 5-carbon molecule called RuBP</li>
            <li>The unstable 6-carbon molecule splits into two 3-carbon molecules (G3P)</li>
            <li>Some G3P is used to make glucose and other organic molecules</li>
            <li>The remaining G3P regenerates RuBP so the cycle can continue</li>
